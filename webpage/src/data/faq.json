    "question": "Why didn't we publish EasyAccess for the public?",
    "answer": "The main reason is that Google Drive's API for full filesystem access requires a verification process that is very difficult to pass, as it requires significant funding that we don't currently have. While this was disappointing, we reminded ourselves that we learned a tremendous amount from this project, which is what matters most at the end of the day. This experience motivated us finish it as we were to release it as a beta product. We are really happy with the end result and hope that by sharing our work, we can inspire others and perhaps even find collaborators who can help us take it further in the future."

    "question": "Is EasyAccess secure to use with my files and accounts?",
    "answer": "Absolutely. EasyAccess uses SHA-256 encryption for local and cloud data, and stores access tokens safely in your browser’s local storage. Nothing is uploaded without your permission, and we never access files unless you authorize it."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I use EasyAccess on multiple devices?",
    "answer": "Yes! EasyAccess works across all major platforms — Windows, macOS, and Linux. Your settings and linked accounts sync seamlessly, so you can access your files from anywhere."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I manage multiple accounts with EasyAccess?",
    "answer": "Yes! You can link multiple Google, Dropbox, and OneDrive accounts. EasyAccess keeps them separated but searchable, making it easy to work across personal and professional spaces."
  },
  {
    "question": "How does EasyAccess protect my privacy?",
    "answer": "We never store your files on our servers. Tokens stay in your local device, and access is read-only unless you explicitly move or copy files. You’re always in control of what’s accessed, and we ask for permission every time."
